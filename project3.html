	<p class="description">In collaboration with acclaimed film company Zentropa, we created a virtual reality experience to promote their upcoming movie "The Snow Queen".<br> <br>Inside the VR experience you find yourself in the icey cave of the Snow Queen. Trapped in a cage of icicles with no way out, you are forced to listen to the Snow Queen while she taunts you and slowly makes her way towards you.<br> <br>If you try to escape and break the icicles, they will regrow in an instant. You are truly forsaken. In the end, she drains the lifeforce out of you and you will drop dead on the spot.<br> <br>The experience was launched with a grand opening covered by the media. Peter Ålbæk Jensen attended the event and praised the product and its capabilities in an interview by TV2. Virtual reality makes a great marketing and promotion tool.</p> <img src="assets/images/zentropa.jpg" alt="zentropa project" class="projectimg">
